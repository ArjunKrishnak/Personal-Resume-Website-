I am an IIT Roorkee alumnus currently working at Amazon. I'm passionate about machine learning and web development. Through my projects and work experience, I was able to familiarize myself how to handle big data, develop POCs around machine learning models and develop machine learning solutions in production. I am also familiar with SOLID design principles, data structures, system design and test-driven development to provide end to end solutions.
